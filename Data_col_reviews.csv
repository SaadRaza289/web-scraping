We toured an insane amount of schools before selecting a home and neighborhood when we moved to Colorado.  And even though we moved 23 mins away from Ivybrook:  it was the best decision we ever made for our son to make the drive.  The classroom made him at ease immediately, the staff is so easy to talk with and be around, super professional but never stuffy, and they have a plan for everything.  He was jazzed to go to school- happy to go.   It’s amazing!  My son opened up socially this year, came home happy and singing songs and had an amazing grasp on science topics that blew my mind.  His classmates were incredibly sweet and kind, and it definitely reflects on the type of community that the school services.  Kind families, great teachers that genuinely care and a fabulous building that offers so much more than you may find anywhere else!  5stars +++ !!",5 stars,5 months ago,Aimee McGonigle,"I can’t say enough good things about this place! They have been so amazing to my son the past two years he attended I wish he could go here for kindergarten. Going to miss this school so much! My son always looked forward to school. He would be so sad if there was a snow day or no school for conferences. I’ve been impressed by all the staff especially Miss Becky! Since my son comes from a split household, she always made sure our son had everything he needed at both households (homework, invitations, etc) Mr Mark is also amazing! On rainy days he would walk families out with umbrellas and always took the time to talk. we will miss everyone here dearly! This school isn’t a school it really is a family.",5 stars,5 months ago

4,Catelyn Engleharthilzer,"I’m giving one star mostly because I feel bad for the teachers. They are so understaffed and overwhelmed. I had a good experience with the teachers, and they worked with my kid, I truly hope the best for them. The owner however is literally the worst and I only had like two weeks of encounters with her. I couldn’t figure out if Stormy is bipolar or a drunk. I would show up in the mornings trying to get to work on time and Stormy would approach me every time saying my kid couldn’t be there because they didn’t have enough people to deal with him. My kid has an IEP and receives therapy next door at the elementary school with Child Find, I gave the teacher star charts and social emotional strategies for my kid that works at home and at the elementary school. But she didn’t have enough help to use those strategies. My kids behavior regressed as soon as he started Kid City. Things we hadn’t seen at all at his early prek started to emerge with an inconsistent environment. But the day we started him at a smaller facility, with more structure, he had a complete turn around. One week out of Kid City and he’s excelling at prek and daycare.

Stormy singled my child out as “too hard” while we watched a kid beat up another kid and hit/kick a teacher. What is really frustrating, her grandchild, who has special needs that goes to there… you would think she would be more supportive.

When I complained to corporate she only became more aggressive and vindictive.

Stormy would change her narrative and ended up Slamming the door in my face refusing to let my kid in the next day. My husband tried to call her to talk to her and she just kept hanging up on him. Her husband answered (who is apparently part owner of the building but unclear if he’s apart of the corporation Kid City) they exchanged words and even threats. But the insane part was after my husband blocked Stormys number her husband continued to call us where he would just hang up on us if we answered (20 calls like that), and then texted my husband calling him names and called the sheriff for harassment.
After digging around , I found out Stormy was let go of Head Start for similar behavior.
If Kid City corporation were to get involved and get a better director In there where Stormy had no part of running this daycare, and if they got more help for the teachers then sure, I would highly recommend this place. The other reviews are all from the employees. But as a parent who works for the district and have been a teacher in public education for the last 10 years, I do not recommend Kid City. If you are having issues with this facility, I highly recommend you call corporate",1 star,a day ago,Brianna Balderrama,"I toured the daycare and I really liked it for my daughter, I asked that no male workers would change my daughter due to trauma. Unfortunately this was something they couldn’t guarantee due to the owner being male and coming into the daycare to work at-least 3 days a week and they also stated they can’t guarantee male workers won’t be hired.",2 stars,4 days ago,Mariah,"Wow.

(We toured a ton of them)  Discovery Trails was the last one and I was skeptical, but after talking with Jen for a while and doing a tour of the school, my wife and I were hopeful.  Needless to say we were thrilled with both her and Mrs. Draper throughout the school year.  Our daughter learned a lot and we're sad the school year is over!

We initially chose a different place and planned on going to that one in the fall because it matched our, at the time, in-home day care environment. Then our, at the time, in-home decided they were going to transition to just infants because they were burnt out on 2y/o. So we called TLE to see if they could take us, they said they had a spot and could accommodate us when we decided. 3 days later our son was going to TLE.

It eases my mind knowing that they take such good care of her and that she genuinely loves being there.,5 stars,5 months ago,Kayla Kagle,"If you want a 5 star quality provider for your child(ren) look no further than Kid City USA!
My daughter has been in daycare since she was 8months old and she will be 2 in August. I transitioned her to Kid City a little over 2 months ago from her previous provider and OH HEAVENS the improvements she has made!

The first thing I absolutely LOVE about KC USA is that they use the ProCare app, this allows me to get updates throughout the day on diaper changes, mealtimes, activities, and pictures too. Who doesn’t love getting a picture of your cute little one doing arts and crafts?!

Next, they actually have a set schedule and follow lesson plans! Have you ever wondered: “Hmm, what is my kid d all day?” Well, at Kid City, they’re learning ABCs, 1-2-3s, Gross & Fine motor skills, reading books, singing nursery rhymes, exploring ocean animals & insects, playing on the playground, riding bikes, etc. (this is a massive upgrade from our previous provider who just had the kids watch coco melon all day)

Last, but certainly not the least by any means, the Staff & the overall facility are phenomenal. The staff is always friendly, welcoming, they’re great at communicating (the ProCare app definitely helps with that), and they’re caring people who love children, many of the staffs own children attend, so that should tell you something! On to the facility, they have one of the cleanest daycares I’ve ever seen. The entire infant room has a wrap around window, so you can see inside from anywhere, the toddler 1 room has a glass wall as well, which I think is amazing for safety reasons. Every classroom also has video surveillance & there is generally always someone in the office monitoring it. Now on to the playground, they have two playgrounds, a large one & smaller one (for the tiny tots!) the playground has two large structures to climb and slide down, it has a bike track , and basketball court. & yes they have bikes of all sizes for the kids to play on! The smaller playground has a pickler and crawl tunnel.

Overall I give Kid City USA of Highlands Ranch a 10/10 rating. Call them and schedule a visit, you won’t be disappointed!",5 stars,5 months ago

I am currently in my senior year of IECE college courses and I am being fully supported by staff and parents to finish my college education. Leadership is assisting with connections, getting enrolled in ECE courses, and being prepared for what a lead teacher position may consist of.

I always look forward to going in and seeing my students and co-workers. Domini (my co-lead in the older infant room) has been there for 4+ years and she has also taught me so much. Together, we have supported the growth of our students and enhanced their lessons so much that we feel our students are proficient in many skills.

All of our students are loved as our own. I love this place and will do so as long as I live.

30,Dengar16,"Bullying is out of control at Hodgkin’s Elementary School.  The principal does not seem to care and blows off concerned parents or grandparents. She does nothing to protect our kids. A slap on the hand to the bully by sending him home for a day or two then the kid comes back and starts bullying all over again. No repercussions—no follow through. We hear about incidents of bullying at Hodgkin’s EVERY DAY, yet you do not create a plan to safeguard the kids or a put together a plan to help prevent the bullying from occurring OR reoccurring.  I realize you have a big job in front of you, but it is still your job. You are responsible for creating a safe environment for our kids. If children suffer anxiety because they are afraid of being the next target, then how can they learn if they’re always watching their back.  It prevents the focus they need to do their school work.

34,statewide angel,This daycare is absolutely amazing both my 6 year old and 4 year old love this place. They also provide transportation to regular schooling if it's in the area. They are absolutely flexible. The communication is tough at times for language barrier but if you give the time and listen it is always true. My children absolutely love going to the center every day.,5 stars,5 months ago,Genevieve Martinez,"My daughter and I absolutely LOVE Statewide Angels, she has been attending since she was about 8mo old, and what an advancement she’s made! She went from hardly crawling to waking just before her 1st bday. They always have fun activities planned for they kids, from going on outings to arts and crafts. They practice things like 1-2-3 & A-B-Cs not only is my daughter happy and excited at drop off & pick up, but so are the other kids (aside from the occasional unhappy camper) The food they serve the kids always smells delicious & though commutation can be challenging at times with the language barriers, they typically will give a written handout letting you know what they did for they day, what they ate & how much, how many diaper changes, and if they napped & how long, etc which I find very helpful. This center doesn’t look like much from the outside, but the care and love they pour into the children in their facility is far greater than a experience your family could have anywhere else. Thank you statewide, I was very skeptical of putting my daughter in daycare, and you have all done a fantastic job at caring for my little one & putting my mind at ease.",5 stars,9 months ago,Kayla Kagle,Amazing staff!

This daycare has all of a sudden been closed at the end of the week for cleaning and barely made the announcement the Tuesday of. I can tell their care and affection for the children is genuine though. My kid absolutely adores his school from what I can tell and he's 2 so.

42,Bronwyn Hockersmith,We love Sunflower! Kathy (the director) is such an incredible person. She’s so patient and consistent. Our kiddo was at the center starting at age 2. The birthday celebration is magic. And they are so intentional with their communication and mindful of the children’s needs. I felt so confident leaving our kiddo with her and her staff.,5 stars,2 months ago,Anna Moore,We cherished our time at Sunflower. Kathy has a truly special and magical way with children and instills a sense of kindness and curiosity worth its weight in gold.,5 stars,6 months ago,Vivienne Chao,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Sunflower Hill as a safe space for any neurodivergent or strong willed child. Despite describing themselves as “dedicated to addressing the uniqueness of each child,” the owner/director Kathy has proven to be inflexible in her approach towards children, seemingly unaware of developmentally appropriate behavior for toddlers,
and unable/unwilling to provide an environment in which all types of children can succeed. I have no complaints against the teachers, except that they clearly do not have the confidence or are not empowered to speak with parents directly and honestly.
Everything funnels through the director in a game of he said/ she said, and ultimately Kathy would prefer to blame and label a child as violent and out of control, than help a child who is clearly struggling with big feelings in a new environment. My son has been in daycares his whole life and no prior caregiver would characterize him as aggressive in any way, but Kathy was quick to do so by day two.
My child attended a total of 4 days. We actively sought feedback from the providers and were met with “he did great"" and then would get a phone call from Kathy days later saying he tried to hit teachers (behavior we almost never see at home), and that we need to make it stop. We asked for more timely feedback and were told it was inappropriate for the teachers to discuss our child's progress at pickup.
In conjunction with my son's therapy team, I provided explicit feedback on strategies that work for de-escalation, which was met with ""thanks, we do most of these things already."" I am not sure these strategies were even shared with the staff. In focusing on my child's negative behaviors, no emphasis was ever placed on ways the providers sought to understand or help my child.
I offered to send someone from my child's therapy team to shadow my child, which did not come to fruition as Kathy terminated our contract, citing aggression towards staff and children. (The ""aggression"" towards children was for pulling another child from a toy car. One can only assume conflict over toys NEVER happens and is totally unacceptable from a toddler on their first day.)
I also want to note that Kathy attempted to justify withholding my child's lunch until he said sorry in a manner that she deemed acceptable (ie., by making eye contact), which demonstrates a completely ableist and authoritarian approach to discipline. She responded to my polite request to not discipline my child this way with wildly exaggerated claims that he punched an employee in the face (although as with most incidents she did not witness this firsthand) while maintaining that forcing a child to parrot a meaningless ""sorry"" for something that happened earlier in the day was the right approach.
If your child is a robot, 100% compliant, and does not emote or demonstrate unpleasant feelings, this might be a great place for you. I will say that the majority of children I noticed at the center were girls around 2 years of age; I suspect they're more pliable. (Also, there's a clear lack of diversity.)
Finally, after refusing to provide service after less than a week and leaving us without childcare options, Kathy still initially declined to refund the several hundred dollar materials fee for the quarter, citing the contract we signed (that she herself terminated). It wasn't until we pressed the issue that we received the refund. This should say a lot about this center's values, general hypocrisy, and the way they run their business.

Edit to add: Kathy’s lengthy, defensive response is on par for her communication style. Instead of being open to feedback and admitting that they can improve the ways they support neurodivergent children or saying she’s sorry we had a bad experience, note that she continues to blame the child. As for her ableist statement that she hopes that we find a “specialized program” for our child’s needs, I’m confident that the only thing my child needs is a welcoming environment with open minded teachers. No specialization needed.",1 star,9 months ago,Ryan Tanner,"Highly recommend Sunflower! Both of our kids attended and we all loved it. The kids' imaginations really exploded while they were at sunflower, spending most of their time outdoors and playing with simple toys and whatever they could supplement from the play yard. They maintain the ability to entertain themselves with whatever they can find in nature, a skill that we give Sunflower a lot of credit for nurturing. Kathy truly creates a magical environment for the kids, full of songs and wonder and curiosity. We also really enjoy the community that Kathy builds with seasonal events and gatherings for the whole sunflower family.",5 stars,a year ago,Christine Tippett,"Every once in a while a photo ""memory"" will pop up on my phone of my kids at Sunflower Hill.  (My kids are now in 5th and 3rd grade.)  Every time I see a photo of the kids at the Sunflower Hill’s Mayday festival, Halloween, visiting St. Nick, celebrating a birthday, hunting for Easter eggs, or playing in Sunflower Hill’s yard, I am eternally grateful for finding Kathy and her wonderful staff at Sunflower Hill.  My daughter was painfully shy when we first enrolled her at 2 years old.  Campbell blossomed at Sunflower Hill.  Kathy’s “curriculum” is exactly what she (and I believe all children) need.  When it was our son’s turn to attend, Kathy held our hands and helped the transition go smoothly.  Cooper had several medical complexities at the time, and Kathy and her staff welcomed him with open arms, always keeping an eye out for Cooper's special needs.  But that didn’t surprise me.  Kathy and her staff keep their eye out for ALL of the children’s needs, special or not. Looking back, Sunflower Hill was the perfect first step for our kids.  I miss Kathy and the warmth, joy and simplicity of Sunflower Hill on a daily basis.  But it’s time for us to do “big kid” things, and I wish all the best to Sunflower Hill, and thank them for helping form our kids (and me!) into who they are today.  If you are considering sending your kids here, you’ve found the right spot.  **Note: These photos are from the previous location on University Blvd.",5 stars,2 years ago
